## How Do?

Its even easier to use thanks to V2 than it was with V1 (And you didnt think that was possible did you).

1. Simply go to: calummcm.github.io 
2. Put the location of where you are (postcode works best for this) a long with however long you are going to be there for. 
3. After clicking 'Get Results!' you can swim in the glory of what is before you and continue forth on your journey with confidence you have not lacked to pack anything essential.
