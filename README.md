It doesn't matter if you're packing the bag for just this afternoon, the weekend or any anyother amount of time up to 8 days, PackWithoutLack has you covered.

## Instructions

Its even easier with V2 than it was with V1 (And you didnt think that was possible did you).

2. Put the location of where you are (postcode works best for this) a long with however long you are going to be there for. 

3. After clicking 'Get Results!' you can swim in the glory of what is before you and continue forth on your journey with confidence you have not lacked to pack anything essential.
